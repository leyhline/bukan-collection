#+TITLE: Identifying Woodblocks from printed Bukan Books
This is kind of backwards...

* Overview
We have 366 scanned books with around 90,000 pages. Now we want to find some links for better understanding the data.

*We have no ground truth!*

So first, let's apply some techniques from classical image processing.


* Various Open Questions
  - Is there a difference between simple 武鑑 and 武鑑大全?

    
* Historical and Cultural Background
** TODO Visit woodblock printing museums [0/3]
*** TODO [[http://www.ukiyoe-ota-muse.jp/][Ota Memorial Museum of Art]]
*** TODO [[https://www.printing-museum.org/][Printing Museum]]
*** TODO [[https://hokusai-museum.jp/][Sumida Hokusai Museum]]
** Reading some Books
   - [x] The Elements of Japanese Design

    
* Working with the Data itself
** TODO Manually examine the collection [33%]
*** DONE Usable in general? [352/366]
    CLOSED: [2019-11-08 Fr 08:10]
*** TODO Measurements of the books [0/366]
    Width, height and position and maybe center line
*** TODO Automatic filtering the books by quantitative measures 
    - Do we have enough books from the same location?
    - Do the number of pages match?

    
* Technical Stuff
** Preprocessing
*** TODO Convert to Greyscale
*** TODO Convert to binary (Black/White)
    You might want to use Histograms for finding good thresholds
** Finding Major Differences
   With perceptual hashes using [[https://phash.org/][pHash]]
** Finding Minor Differences
   Aligning/Registering the images and doing pixelwise comparison
** Various Notes
   - Maybe take a look at [[https://halide-lang.org/][Halide]]
   

* Bibliography
  First, find some papers/journals to read.
** TODO Prepare BibTeX environment
