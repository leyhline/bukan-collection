This is kind of backwards...

    I thing I need a low-level approach here since my computer is so slow.
    So: C++/C/Rust (don't know how its FFI works here)
    *Result: Did not work*

* Overview
We have 366 scanned books with around 90,000 pages. Now we want to find some links for better understanding the data.

*We have no ground truth!*

So first, let's apply some techniques from classical image processing.


* Problems
** Easy?
   Seem to be solved with standard tools; just need to find the right parameters.
   - Page detection
** Medium?
   There are some current papers on this; harder than it seems but there are some working approaches.
   - Page binarization
** Hard?
   There are no (useful) existing approaches and therefore no existing tools.
   But it seems this isn't the problem here. The task is /too easy/. ;)


* Various Open Questions
  - [X] Is there a difference between simple 武鑑 and 武鑑大全?
    Not sure, maybe just a different edition.

    
* Historical and Cultural Background
** TODO Visit woodblock printing museums [0/3]
*** TODO [[http://www.ukiyoe-ota-muse.jp/][Ota Memorial Museum of Art]]
*** TODO [[https://www.printing-museum.org/][Printing Museum]]
*** TODO [[https://hokusai-museum.jp/][Sumida Hokusai Museum]]
** Reading some Books
   - [X] The Elements of Japanese Design

    
* Working with the Data itself
** TODO Manually examine the collection [66%]
*** DONE Usable in general? [352/366]
    CLOSED: [2019-11-08 Fr 08:10]
*** TODO Measurements of the books [0/366]
    Width, height and position and maybe center line
    But it should be possible to just automate this
*** DONE Automatic filtering the books by quantitative measures 
    CLOSED: [2019-11-21 木 18:50]
    - Do we have enough books from the same location?
    - Does the number of pages match?

      
* Technical Stuff
** Preprocessing
*** DONE Convert to Greyscale
    CLOSED: [2019-11-30 Sa 12:17]
    Do this in memory
*** TODO Convert to binary (Black/White)
    You might want to use Histograms for finding good thresholds
    "Document Image Binarization"
** DONE Finding Major Differences
   CLOSED: [2019-11-22 金 09:40]
   With perceptual hashes using [[https://phash.org/][pHash]]
   *Result: Did not work!*
** Finding Minor Differences
   Aligning/Registering the images and doing pixelwise comparison
